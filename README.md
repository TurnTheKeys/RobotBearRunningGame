# Robot Bear Running Game
## How I worked on this project
My goal was to practise coding in the language of C# in an unfamiliar form.
- I followed the tutorial to understand how to work around asp.net: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35RTKAFDjY0&t=1514s&pp=ygUsaW5maWluaXRlIGRpbm9zYXVyIHJ1bm5uaW5nIGdhbWUgIEMjIGFzcC5uZXQ%3D)
- Afterwards I worked on changing the code such as: 
 - Designed and created additional entities
 - Separating the entities as different objects
 - Changed the jumping mechanics of the game
 - Added comments throughout to help understanding in future

## How to navigate the project
- **Obstacles** code are labelled as _Obstacle_(Obstacle Name)
 - This separates the different movement paths of the entities as well as their movement paths
- **RobotBear** code holds the code for the players
 - This includes things such as movements and sprite changes
- **Form1** code holds the game code

## Why I built the project this way
- I wanted to practise coding a project during my semester break
- This allowed for me to practise a code I was familiar with an unfamiliar setting, something that had a graphical interface

## If I had more time I would change this
- Add sound effects and music to the game
- Separate the game into it's own class to keep form1 clean and the game separate
